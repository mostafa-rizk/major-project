# Log Message for Major Project for Week 1
## What was your goal for the past week?

My goal was to write a significant chunk of the program so that for the two remaining weeks I would not be under pressure. It was also my goal to not be overambitious, resulting in a project that would never be finished, or start working on a project which is way outside of my current level of experience and knowledge.

## Did you accomplish last weekâ€™s goal? Why/why not?

Yes, I accomplished last week's goal. I was able to almost completely finish my program. More importantly, I was able to figure out what problems I might encounter along the way and was able to break down how to overcome those problems, not just by any means possible, but with efficiency and elegance in mind.

## What did you learn this week?

I learned about two other possible solutions for my solving algorithm, as well as how my implementation could be used in other programs such as chess, checkers, go, and so on. I also learned that while other solving algorithms do exist and can be much more efficient, they are drastically more complex and much more difficult to implement.

## What is your goal for next week?

My goal for next week is to have my project finished and to hopefully be able to refine it so that it runs as well as I want it to. I never want to leave a project because I've completed the criteria or the goal. There is always more to add and better ways to implement your code, and that's what I'm hoping to do next week.

## What are the main challenges you are facing next week?

I don't believe I'll be facing any challenges next week, however I would like to try different solving algorithms and possibly test my project on larger size grids (for example, 9x9). I believe everything is accounted for, and any challenges that should arise I believe I will be able to handle without much trouble.
