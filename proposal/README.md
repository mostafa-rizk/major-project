# README : proposal

__Read these instructions carefully before you start writing your proposal__

After the pitch you are required to reflect on the feedback you recieved from your peers and from your teacher (see the feedback.md file in the pitch folder) and use this as the basis for your project proposal. For the project proposal you need to complete the appropriate Markdown form that is located in this folder. Make sure you answer all the questions completelly and with all the necessary details included. Include pictures, sketches, videos, links and other supplememntary material as necessary. 

There are three verions of the proposal template file. You only have to complete one of the versions. The version you complete depends on the nature of your project:
* __proposal-gameEngine.md__: Use this version if you will be using a game engine for your project, e.g. Unity, RPG Maker, Roblox Studio
* __proposal-programingLanguage.md__: Use this version if you will make your project using a programing language, e.g. Processing, Python, JavaScript, Java, C/C++, Lua, etc.
* __proposal-webPage.md__: Use this version if you will be building a web page as your main product.

For a proposal to be successful it needs to get a mark of at least 50%. Unsuccessful proposal (a mark of <50%) will have to be revised and handed in again (until they recieve a mark of at least 50%).

The following is the marking rubric that will be used for marking the proposal.
