## Expectations
In this assignment you will use project-based learning to connect and extend your previous learning in computer science. Take this assignment as a learning experience, not an easy grade. Your success will suffer if you do not sincerely pursue a project that interests you.

## Project Selection
While you have freedom in selecting your project based on your interests (i.e. you have lots of freedom when choosing a project) your project has to fullfill all the following criteria:

* You must be passionate about your project
* Result in a final product (software, hardware, digital resource, etc.) 
* You must able to access it at school every day for the rest of the class (physically and/or virtually)
* Connect to topics and concepts covered in Computer Science 10
* Using git and GitHub for source control management
* Cannot consist of only binaries
* Legal to develop and use 
* Must be safe for you and for the user

## Collaborative Projects
Collaborative projects are approved on an individual basis and require all the students in the group to have shown mastery of git/GitHub concepts and workflow. Talk to your teacher if you are considering a collaborative project.

## Evaluation
The following components of the major project are evaluated:

1. Pitch (10%)
2. Proposal (10%)
3. Log entries and source control management (50%)
4. Presentation (20%)
5. Final product (10%)

## Keeping up to date with the master repository
To keep your local assignmetn repository up to date with your teacher's repository you need to issue the following commands from the terminal:
```
git add upstream https://github.com/mariopineda/CSE1910-CSE-Project-A
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/master
```

The first time you are updating your local assignment repository you need to run all three commands, subsequent updates will only require the second and third command.

## Building Web Pages
This repository has been set up with a web page template. To access the source code for the web page template you need to change the current working branch to the gh-pages. You can access the web site through the browser at http://mariopineda.github.io/CSE1910-CSE-Project-A/.
